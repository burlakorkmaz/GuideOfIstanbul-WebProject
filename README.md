# GuideOfIstanbul-WebProject

## How The Project Was Implemented
* I started with creating our first page ( index.html ) with HTML-CSS
* I designed the homepage ( index.html )
* I added slider with the help of JavaScript
* I also added a menu with using javascript and changed some variables to show up if the browser width is small enough 
* I almost used the same pattern while creating lower contents.For the Tours topic, I directed the users to GetYourGuide website. For the maps topic, I prepared a map with google maps and put it to the page.
